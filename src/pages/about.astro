            I'm Chandrima Ganguly — researcher, strategist, and advocate for AI that serves
            humanity's best interests.
          </p>
          <p class="text-deep-earth/70 leading-relaxed">
            With a Ph.D. and years of experience at the intersection of artificial intelligence,
            ethics, and organizational transformation, I've dedicated my career to a single question:
            <span class="font-semibold text-forest-deep">How do we harness AI's transformative
            power while staying true to our values?</span>

        <h2 class="text-center mb-12">My Story</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-deep-earth/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My path to responsible AI consulting wasn't linear — and I believe that's what makes
          my perspective valuable. I've seen AI from multiple angles: as a researcher pushing
          the boundaries of what's possible, as a practitioner implementing systems in the real
          world, and as an advisor helping organizations navigate the complex ethical terrain
          that surrounds every AI decision.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-deep-earth/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Through this journey, I've witnessed both the tremendous potential of AI and the very
          real harm that can come from thoughtless implementation. I've seen startups move fast
          and break things — including trust. I've seen social enterprises struggle to adopt AI
          because the tools weren't designed with their constraints in mind. And I've seen
          government bodies paralyzed by the complexity of AI governance, unsure how to move
          forward responsibly.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-deep-earth/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          These experiences shaped my approach. I don't believe we have to choose between
          innovation and responsibility. <span class="highlight">The best AI innovations are
          the intentional ones</span> — those that begin with a clear understanding of purpose,
          proceed with appropriate safeguards, and continuously evolve based on real-world impact.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-deep-earth/80 leading-relaxed">
          Today, I work primarily with startups, social enterprises, NGOs, and government bodies
          — organizations that are driven by mission, not just metrics. These are the organizations
          that have the most to gain from AI done right, and the most to lose from AI done wrong.
          Helping them navigate this landscape with confidence and clarity is what drives my work.
